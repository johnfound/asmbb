## Paragraphs

The paragraphs are separated by empty line or by starting a block element like block quote, source code or similar.

## Inline formatting:

The text can be formatted by enclosing with the specified symbols:

`*Bold text*` = *Bold text*

`/Italic text/` = /Italic text/

`_Underlined text_` = _Underlined text_

`-Strikedthrough-` = -Strikedthrough-

 `Monospaced inline text`  = `Monospaced inline text`

`_*/The formats can be combined/*_` = _*/The formats can be combined/*_

## Headers

The headers are formatted by starting the line with `#` symbol(s), then whitespace and then the header text.
There should be an empty line, after the header.
The number of "#" symbols sets the level of the header.
From 1 to 6:
;begin nohighlight
# H1 header

## H2 header

### H3 header

#### H4 header

##### H5 header

###### H6 header

####### Regular paragraph.
;end

# H1 header

## H2 header

### H3 header

#### H4 header

##### H5 header

###### H6 header

####### Regular paragraph.


## Links:

;ulist
* Label type links:

The link labels are defined following way, starting from the first column of the line:
;begin nohighlight
 [AsmBB site] https://board.asm32.info/
;end

The label can be used in the text following way:

;begin nohighlight
  Visit [AsmBB site] for details.
;end

The link text can be changed by adding the prefered text in another square brackets, directly after the label:

;begin nohighlight
  Visit the [AsmBB site][fastest forum in the world].
;end

The above examples, rendered:

;quote Example
Visit [AsmBB site] for details.

Visit the [AsmBB site][fastest forum in the world].
;end

The defined label can be used multiple times, before or after the definition line.

[AsmBB site] https://board.asm32.info/


* Inline links:

Instead of defining label, the link URL can be specified directly in the text, enclosed in square brackets. Optionally a different link text can be added in another square brackets:

;begin nohighlight
  Visit [https://board.asm32.info] for details.

  Visit the [https://board.asm32.info][fastest forum in the world].
;end

;quote Example
  Visit [https://board.asm32.info] for details.

  Visit the [https://board.asm32.info][fastest forum in the world].
;end

* Image and media links:

The image, video and sound links are defined the same way as the normal links. With the difference, that the label/URL should be preceded with a symbol defining the type of the media:

"?" for the inline image, "!" for the block image and "$" for a media type link - video or audio file.

There are several predefined links for the forum emoticons:

`[?:-)], [?:)] or [?smile]`=[?:)]

`[?:-D], [?:D] or [lol]`=[?:-D]

`[?rofl]`=[?rofl]

`[?;-)] [?;)] [wink]`=[?;-)]

`[?:-P] or [?:P]`=[?:-P]

`[?:-(], [?:(] or [sad]`=[?:-(]

`[?:'-(], [?:'(] or [cry]`=[?:'-(]

`[?>:-(], [?>:(] or [angry]`=[?>:-(]

Notice, that the type symbol should be included only in the place where the image is used.
The label definition should not contain type symbols. You can use the same label with different type symbols.
For example the above smile emoticon as a block: `[!:-)]` = [!:-)]

;end ulist

## Block quote:

The block quote definition:
;begin nohighlight
 ;quote QUOTE LABEL
 QUOTE TEXT
 ;end
;end

;quote QUOTE LABEL
QUOTE TEXT
;end

Block quotes can contain other formatting elements and can be nested.

## Source code block:

The source code blocks are created following way:

;begin nohighlight
 ;begin LANG
   SomeSourceCode();
 ;end
;end

The LANG (optional) is the language of the source. It is needed for the syntax highlighting, but the
[https://highlightjs.org/][used library] can autodetect the languages pretty well.

If "nohighlight" is specified for the language, the block is not highlighted at all.

## Horizontal ruler

Defined by semicolon at the first column, followed by at least 3 minus symbols:

;begin nohighlight
 ;----------------
;end

;quote Example
;-----------------
;end

## Lists

The lists are block elements, defined by the keywords `ulist` for the unordered list and `olist` for ordered list.

The list item elements are defined by asterisk symbol on the first column, followed by the text of the item.

The following paragraphs belongs to the current list item.

The lists can be nested freely:

;begin nohighlight
 ;ulist
 * Bullet item 1
 ;olist
 * Num item 1

 * Num item 2
 ;end
 * Bullet item 2
 ;ulist
 * Nested bullet item.

 * Another nested bullet item.
 ;end
 ;end
;end

;ulist
* Bullet item 1
;olist
* Num item 1

* Num item 2
;end
* Bullet item 2
;ulist
* Nested bullet item.

* Another nested bullet item.
;end
;end


## Spoiler element

The spoiler is an element with initially hiden content that can be expanded by the reader if he wants to read the content.

;begin nohighlight
 ;spoiler SPOILER TITLE
 SPOILER CONTENT
 ;end
;end

;spoiler SPOILER TITLE
SPOILER CONTENT
;end

The spoiler can contain any nested elements.


## Tables

The tables are started by the keyword `;table` at the beginning of the line. The rows are separated by `;------` preceded by an empty line
(in order to finish the last paragraph) and every paragraph in the row is a separate table cell.

If you start the paragraph in the table with "#" - it will be formatted as a table header.

You can use inline formatting, images and links inside the table cells. See the example:

;begin nohighlight
 ;table
 # Header 0,0

 # Header 0,1

 # Header 0,2

 ;-----------------
 Cell with [https://board.asm32.info][link] 1,0

 Cell with inline /*formatting*/ 1,1

 Cell 1,2

 ;-----------------
 Cell 2,0

 Cell with inline image: [?;-)] 2,1

 Cell with block image: [!;-)] 2,2
 ;end
;end

;table
# Header 0,0

# Header 0,1

# Header 0,2

;-----------------
Cell with [https://board.asm32.info][link] 1,0

Cell with inline /*formatting*/ 1,1

Cell 1,2

;-----------------
Cell 2,0

Cell with inline image: [?;-)] 2,1

Cell with block image: [!;-)] 2,2
;end
